API --> application programming interface
        - it helps different applications to communicate and share data with each other
        - API is a middle man

                       request |----->>>>           |----->>>>  BRITISH  AIRWAYS
        SKYSCANNER ---------------->> API ----------|-->>>>>    TURKISH AIRLINES
                       response <<----------        |----->>>>  EMIRATES AIRLINES

        Skyscanner gets different airline data using their apis



API methods
    most common ones
        - get  ----->> retrieve/get a piece of data
        - post ----->> send data
        - put ------>> update a piece of data
        - delete ---->> delete/remove data


    *** Java uses selenium as an API to interact with browser
    *** Java uses JDBC as an API to interact with SQL


There are 2 different types of APIs
    - SOAP >>> is not very popular in today's tech world --->> xml format
    - REST -- >> it uses http protocol
            - it supports any machine-readable format xml, any others, especially JSON






Microservices ---------->>> small services providing/designing a functionality of a software.
                Amazon ->>> Search, Account, Shipment, Payment
                           - These microservices are small pieces of data (api), they can be used to build amazon database
                           for any type of software machine like web, phone, ipad.

                       ** So basically it just needs to be connected with database using microservice  or api
                       and all types can use same database.

************************************************************** What is API testing? Why do we need to  test ? ********************************************************************************


API testing -------------->>>> is completely different from UI testing it concentrates on software architecture rather than its look and design.


Api testing requires an application to interact with api.
In order to test api, you will need to:
                                        - use testing tool to drive api  ------ Postman
                                        - write your own code
                                            - using restAssured Library and java code



*** Api testing is faster than UI testing
*** It can be tested before UI is built, in the earlier lifecycle. (save cost and time)
*** Becoming more popular on market
*** Time efficiency
*** Cost effective/ Save costs

************************************************************** Api test setup/Understanding the documentation  ***************************************************************************************************************

We need to know api methods and endpoints
    - read api documentation
    - swagger tools


We use POSTMAN to test apis




HTTP Status code is the first test that we need make sure it is successful
    200 ---> OK <-- 2XX
    404 ---> Not found (our side error) <--- 4XX
    500 ---> Server/Api error (not our side) <--- 5XX


****** Swagger api documentation tool gives all information about how to interact with the api, and we follow the given structure and rules



********* Test step to verify :
                               - status code success 200
                               - response body verification
